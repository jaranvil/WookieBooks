# WookieBooks
This is a demostration project I coded on March 27th, 2022. It is an implementation of a RESTful .NET Core API for a bookstore. It uses a EF Core In-Mmemory repository with two default book records.

## Deployment

The API is hosted as a Azure App Service here:
https://wookiebooks20220327145308.azurewebsites.net

## Postman Test

A collection of Postman tests are located in /PostmantTest/WookieBooks.postman_collection.json
